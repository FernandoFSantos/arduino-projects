The present work aims to elaborate a low cost, flexible and easy to handle prototype, towards to monitor some parameters associated with the salubrity conditions of the agricultural tractor operator’s working environment, which are: sound pressure level, ambient temperature and relative air humidity. The developed prototype acquire data through low-cost sensors and interprets the analyzed parameters comparing their values to those recommended by the Brazilian Regulatory Standards 15 (Unhealthy Operations and Activities) and 17 (Ergonomics), in order to perform a salubrity analysis of the local environmental conditions and to issue visual alerts to the operator when any parameter is outside the range of interest. In order to monitor the ambient temperature and relative air humidity, the AM2302/DHT22® sensor (Aosong Electronics Company) was adopted. Regarding the sound pressure level monitoring, the Sparkfun Sound Detector® sensor was used.
